SELECT 
    productname, 
    buyprice
FROM
    products p1
WHERE
    buyprice > (SELECT 
            AVG(buyprice)
        FROM
            products
        WHERE
            productline = p1.productline)

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products
where SupplierID=3) and supplierid=3;

here we see avg works if no constrin then find avg of whole table
productline=p1.productline if you want to check self values
